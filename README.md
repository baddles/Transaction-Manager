# Transaction-Manager
A current work-in-progress project, aimed for personal use.<br>
For every purchase, user will create a "BillInfo", where it would have the purchase date, details of purchase, price of bill (with ability to insert discount if user wants), and image of bill - which will be uploaded to Imgur.<br>
The user can also use an API to view how much money has been spent in a day/month/year/time period.<br>
User can also export their BillInfo to a spreadsheet.<br>

# Currently-working feature list
